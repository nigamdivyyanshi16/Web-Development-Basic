	<p> WHAT IS BLUE BRAIN?<br>
       Blue brain is the name of the world’s first virtual brain that can function as human brain. Today
       scientists are in research to create an artificial brain that can think, response, take decision, and keep
       anything in memory. The main aim is to upload human brain into machine. So that man can think,
       take decision without any effort. After the death of the body, the virtual brain will act as the man .So,
       even after the death of a person we will not lose the knowledge, intelligence, personalities, feelings
	and memories of that man that can be used for the development of the human society.
	The IBM is now developing a virtual brain known as the Blue brain. It would be the world’s first virtual
	brain. Within 30 years, we will be able to scan ourselves into the computers.</p>

  <blockquote>
    The brain builds a version of the universe and projects this version of the universe like a bubble all around us. So I can say with some certainty, 'I think therefore I am'. But I cannot say 'You think there you are', because you are within my perceptual bubble

      <h4 class="heading-4">Blue Brain Technology</h4>
      <p>Blue Brain, an Artificial Brain which is an initiative taken by Swiss brain research. The Blue brain
	project was initially founded on May 2005 at Brain and mind institute named EPFL (École
	Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) in Switzerland that specializes in natural sciences and
	engineering.<br>
	Project blue brain is headed by Henry Markram, professor at EPFL. The blue brain is using a
	supercomputer which was created by IBM called as “Blue Gene” which runs software developed
	by Michael Hines’s and John Moore named “NEURON”, a simulation environment which models
	network of neurons in human brain.it’s been said that by 2023 project will be launched officially.

      <h4 class="heading-4">THE NEED AND OBJECTIVES OF VRTUAL BRAIN</h4>
      <p>Main objective behind Artificial brain is to establish a connection in between human brain and
artificial brain so that machine can work like a human brain and important content of humans like
knowledge, feelings, memories of a person be downloaded to artificial brain by applying high
computational algorithms using supercomputers with large storage facilities which can be used
forever for different purposes until erased.  Before death of human beings, all contents of brain can be
extracted using an Artificial brain and can be used forever. The artificial brain can also be used in
research of treatment for diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.

    <div class="card">
      <h4 class="heading-4">HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?</h4>
      <p>The information is uploaded from human brain to supercomputers using a small robots called as
“nanobots”.Then after
entering brain, nanobots starts scanning and monitoring structure of neurons.
Connection between computer is formed by using nanobots as a interface and software that
is used is known as “BBP-SDK”. The BBP-SDK data from nanobots and visualizations of collected data
is done using a data visualization software called as “RT Neuron” written in C++.
The final data is stored in databases and will be used for further modelling of human brain
functions.If this experiment is successful then knowledge of brain can be stored and examined.
